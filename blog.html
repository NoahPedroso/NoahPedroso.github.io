            <p>I've just created my portfolio site on Github pages. It doesn't look great because I am still kind of learning front-end technologies. I'd really like to have one dedicated place for all my work though, and also a place to talk about what I've learned from it. Perhaps it will inspire me to make more projects consistently. I think this could also host other thing than professional projects, but we'll see. Right now, this blog is secret. I'm excited to see this grow. I eventually I want to leave Github Pages.</p>
